# Pokemon-Search-App
 creating a Pokemon Pokedex using the Pokemon API for my final code camp project. This project is a representation of my ability to retrieve data from an API using the fetch API innate to javascript.
 I use this API to populate the application based on a given Pokemon stats, weight, typing, etc. A minor supplementary component of this web application is to be able to use enter to input pokemon names and ids to search.
